### Spark SQL Analysis of Flight On-Time Performance  

This project demonstrates my ability to analyze large structured datasets using **Apache Spark**, with a focus on **Spark SQL** and the **Scala API**. The analysis explores flight on-time performance data, highlighting key insights derived through SQL queries, aggregations, and data discovery.

---

## Objective  
To analyze flight on-time data and airport metadata using Spark, answering both specific and open-ended business questions. This project showcases skills in:  
- **Data querying and aggregation** using Spark SQL.  
- **Exploratory data analysis** to uncover patterns and trends.  
- **Efficient handling of large datasets** using distributed data processing with Apache Spark.

## Project Highlights  

### **Data Sources:**  
- **NovOntime.csv**: Contains flight performance data.  
- **Airports.csv**: Provides additional information about airports.  

### **Key Tasks:**  
- **Data Exploration:** Reading and inspecting the datasets to understand structure, distribution, and potential issues.  
- **Targeted Queries:** Answering specific questions, such as identifying the most delayed flights and busiest airports.  
- **Open-Ended Analysis:** Using multiple queries to derive deeper insights, including performance trends and factors influencing delays.

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Apache Spark**: Spark SQL and DataFrame API for distributed data processing.  
- **Scala**: Primary programming language for Spark operations.  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment to document and run the analysis.  

---

## Sample Insights (Teasers)  
- Which airports experience the highest delays?  
- Are certain airlines consistently on time across different seasons?  
- Trends in on-time performance and the impact of airport size or location.
